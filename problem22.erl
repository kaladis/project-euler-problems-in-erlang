%% Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text
%% file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it
%% into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for
%% each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the
%% list to obtain a name score.

%% For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN,
%% which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the
%% list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.

%% What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
